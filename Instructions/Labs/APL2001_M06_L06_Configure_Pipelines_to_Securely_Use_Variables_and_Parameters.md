# Learning Lab: Configure pipelines to securely use variables and parameters

This exercise takes approximately **45** minutes.

## Lab overview

In this lab, understand the importance of configuring pipelines to use variables and parameters securely in Azure DevOps. This lab covers fundamental concepts and best practices for ensuring that parameters and variables retain their type, identifying and restricting insecure use of parameters and variables, moving parameters into a YAML file that protects their type, limiting variables that can be set at queue time, and validating that mandatory variables are present and set correctly.

## Objectives

After you complete this lab, you will be able to:

- Ensure that parameters and variables retain their type.
- Identify and restrict insecure use of parameters and variables.
- Move parameters into a YAML file that protects their type.
- Limit variables that can be set at queue time.
- Validate that mandatory variables are present and set correctly in Azure DevOps.

## Before you start

You'll need an Azure subscription, Azure DevOps organization, and the eShopOnWeb application to follow the labs.

- Follow the steps to [validate your lab environment](APL2001_M00_Validate_Lab_Environment.md).
