# Lab: Configure a project and repository structure to support secure pipelines

In this lab, you will learn how to configure a project and repository structure in Azure DevOps to support secure pipelines. This lab covers best practices for organizing projects and repositories, assigning permissions, and managing secure files.

These exercises take approximately **30** minutes.

## Before you start

You'll need an Azure subscription, Azure DevOps organization, and the eShopOnWeb application to follow the labs.

- Follow the steps to [validate your lab environment](APL2001_M00_Validate_Lab_Environment.md).

## Instructions

### Exercise 1: Configure a secure project structure

In this exercise, you will configure a secure project structure by creating a new project and assigning it project permissions. Separating processes and resources into different projects supports security.

#### Task 1: Create a new project

#### Task 2: Assign project permissions

### Exercise 2: Configure a secure repository structure

In this exercise, you will configure a secure repository structure by creating a new repository in your project, adding secure files, assigning security roles and access, and moving the security-related files away from the main project.

#### Task 1: Create a repository

#### Task 2: Add secure files

#### Task 3: Assign security roles and access for all files in the Library

#### Task 4: Move the security-related files

## Review

In this lab, you learned how to configure and organize a secure project and repository structure in Azure DevOps. By managing permissions effectively, you can ensure that the right users have access to the resources they need while maintaining the security and integrity of your DevOps pipelines and processes.
